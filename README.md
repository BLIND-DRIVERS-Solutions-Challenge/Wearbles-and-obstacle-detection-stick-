# Wearable Obstacle Detection Stick

## Overview
The **Wearable Obstacle Detection Stick** is an innovative device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. By combining wearable technology and ultrasonic sensors, this stick provides real-time feedback about obstacles, helping users avoid collisions and move safely.

## Key Features
1. **Ultrasonic Sensors**: The stick is equipped with ultrasonic sensors that emit sound waves and measure their reflection time to detect nearby objects. These sensors create a protective zone around the user, alerting them to obstacles within a certain range.

2. **Vibration Feedback**: When an obstacle is detected, the stick provides haptic feedback through gentle vibrations. The intensity of the vibration corresponds to the proximity of the obstacle.

3. **Wearable Design**: The stick is lightweight and can be comfortably worn by attaching it to a belt or harness. Users can carry it hands-free, allowing them to use their hands for other tasks.

4. **Adjustable Sensitivity**: Users can customize the sensitivity of the obstacle detection system based on their preferences and environment. For crowded areas, higher sensitivity may be necessary, while lower sensitivity can be set for open spaces.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Array**: The stick features an array of ultrasonic sensors positioned at different angles. These sensors continuously scan the surroundings, measuring distances to objects.

2. **Microcontroller**: A microcontroller processes the sensor data and determines if an obstacle is present. If an obstacle is detected, it triggers the vibration feedback mechanism.

3. **Vibration Motor**: The stick incorporates a small vibration motor that produces vibrations. The intensity and duration of vibrations depend on the proximity of the obstacle.

## Development Status
We are currently in the **development phase** of the Wearable Obstacle Detection Stick. Our team is refining the design, optimizing sensor placement, and fine-tuning the sensitivity levels. We are committed to creating a reliable and user-friendly solution for visually impaired individuals.
